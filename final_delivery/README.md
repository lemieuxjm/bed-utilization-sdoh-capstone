# 📦 Final Delivery

This folder contains the finalized deliverables for the capstone project:  
**Non-COVID Hospital Bed Utilization Monitoring Using SDOH Data (County-Level, 2020).**

## 📂 Folder Structure

- 'code/': Final modeling code and notebooks.
- 'data/': Final cleaned datasets used in analysis.
- 'visualizations/EDAVisualizations/figures/': Final polished plots and charts used in the report (PNG format).
- 'reports/': Final reports submitted for evaluation.
- 'appendix/': Additional technical documentation.

## 🔑 Key Files

- **Final Model Notebook:**  
  'code/Final_SDOH_HospitalBedUtil_Prediction_Model.ipynb'
  
- **Final Cleaned Dataset:**  
  'data/MERGED_SDOH_PLUS_BED_UTIL.xlsx'

- **Final Report:**  
  'reports/Final_Report.pdf'
  - https://github.com/lemieuxjm-cap/Iota-Capstone/tree/b54e30e85a106960d5a4c6f652c9ad589bc83f79/final_delivery/reports

## 🛠️ Running the Code

- The notebooks were developed and run in **Google Colab.**
- To run locally in **Jupyter Notebook:**
  - Use 'print()' for any outputs (e.g., dataframes, plots) that don't automatically display.
  - Ensure 'rpy2' is installed to support R code chunks:
    '''bash
    pip install rpy2
    '''
- The notebook contains R code blocks using '%%R' magic, and these include:
  - 'install.packages()' calls for necessary R packages (e.g., 'corrplot', 'ggcorrplot', 'olsrr', etc.), so **no extra R setup is needed.**

## 🔎 Notes

- The full set of preliminary data acquisition, SQL scripts, and merging steps is archived in the 'development_test/data/PreliminaryMergedData/' folder for transparency and reproducibility.
- All polished figures are stored in 'visualizations/EDAVisualizations/figures/' for easy access.
